A smaller game project that took 3 months for me and 5 other students to complete. Made in one of the students OpenGL engine.  

It is a 2 to 4-player local multiplayer game where you control vehicles and ompete against your friends to be the last car standing.  

I mainly dealt with the UI and menues as well as the scoring system.  

Since this was my first real game project I have parts that I am less proud of. For example there is a some of duplicate code that could have been made into functions. But learning form these mistakes has help me become a petter programmer.
